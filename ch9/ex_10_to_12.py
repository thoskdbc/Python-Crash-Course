# 9-10. Imported Restaurant: Using your latest Restaurant class, store it in a mod-
# ule. Make a separate file that imports Restaurant. Make a Restaurant instance,
# and call one of Restaurant’s methods to show that the import statement is work-
# ing properly.
from restaurant import Restaurant
restaurant = Restaurant('kfc', 'american')
restaurant.describe_restaurant()



# 9-11. Imported Admin: Start with your work from Exercise 9-8 (page 173).
# Store the classes User, Privileges, and Admin in one module. Create a sepa-
# rate file, make an Admin instance, and call show_privileges() to show that
# everything is working correctly.
from user import Admin
admin = Admin('robert', 'sandler')
admin.privileges.show_privileges()



# 9-12. Multiple Modules: Store the User class in one module, and store the
# Privileges and Admin classes in a separate module. In a separate file, create
# an Admin instance and call show_privileges() to show that everything is still
# working correctly.
from admin import Admin
admin = Admin("Dani", "becker")
admin.privileges.show_privileges()
